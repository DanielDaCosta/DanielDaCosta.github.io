  abstract = {Piezoeletric materials are used on high-precision and high-dynamics applications, such as for acoustic transmission. This paper covers the challenges of creating a black-box model for a simultaneous acoustic transmission problem, with data acquired in a laboratory setup. The system performance is analyzed for three different models: AutoRegressive Moving Average with eXogenous inputs (ARMAX) model, Nonlinear AutoRegressive with eXogenous inputs (NARX) model with artificial neural network structure, and Nonlinear AutoRegressive Moving Average with eXogenous inputs (NARMAX) models. The best results of each models are compared with respect to precision in free-run simulation. The prediction results show that the most complex NARMAX model had the best results, what encourages further research in creating nonlinear mathematical data-driven abstractions for the piezoacoustic transmission application.},

  title={Comparison of linear and nonlinear methods for systems identification with piezoeletric materials and acoustic transmission},
  author={Daniel Pereira {da Costa}},
  abstract={Piezoelectric materials are materials capable of producing an electric current when subjected to mechanical stress. On the other hand, these materials are physically deformed when an electric field is applied to them. In this work, piezoelectrics are used for data acquisition through an acoustic tunnel and thus apply systems identification techniques to the system modeling process. This work aims to identify an acoustic transmission system through black box system identification methods. Specifically, the AutoRegressive with eXogenous Inputs (ARX) and AutoRegressive Moving Average with eXogenous Inputs (ARMAX) linear models and Nonlinear AutoRegressive with eXogenous Inputs (NARX) model with artificial neural network structure are used. This project encompasses all stages of a systems identification process, from data acquisition to results. The results obtained are compared with the ARX model and the ARMAX model. The prediction conclusion shows that the best result was obtained with the ARMAX model.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
